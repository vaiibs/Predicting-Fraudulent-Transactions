# **Fraud Detection using Deep Learning**

The goal of this project is to predict whether a transaction is fraudulent based on its features.

This project involves building a deep learning model to detect fraudulent transactions from a dataset of financial transactions. 

Fraudulent transactions are rare, making the dataset highly imbalanced, which requires the use of resampling techniques such as SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique).

Dataset
The dataset is a CSV file with 6,362,620 rows and 10 columns.

Performance Metrics

      Precision: Measures the accuracy of fraud predictions.
      
      Recall: Measures how many actual frauds were correctly identified.
      
      F1-Score: Harmonic mean of precision and recall, representing the balance between them.
